This boilerplate was created to help you easily and quickly start developing websites with my favorite css framework - tailwind. It uses Webpack and tailwindcss. Images optimization is also included in the webpack settings.

## Usage

To use this boilerplate: 

1. click "Use this template" green button in the top right. If you prefer you can use git clone or just download the zip file.

2. Install dependencies - type npm install or yarn
